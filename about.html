        <h2>MAKAYLA POLAK</h2>
        <p>Hey there! My name is MaKayla Polak and I am a proud owner of 28 tattoos. I tattooed myself for the first time when I was 14 and never stopped since.
				I am a firm believer that your tattoos tell alot about youx. I get tattoos as memorial pieces, whether that be for a lost one or for a hard moment in my life
			that I want to put to rest, but want to remember my strength through it. I currently live in Missouri, but have gotten tattoos all around the US. </p>
