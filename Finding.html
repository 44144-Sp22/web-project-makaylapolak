        <h2>Having a Unique Tattoo</h2>
        <p>When you are getting a tattoo, the first thing that you should be thinking about is what tattoo you are getting. You want a tattoo that is going to represent you.
				You do not want a tattoo that someone else is going to have or a tattoo that a lot of people have. Finding the right tattoo for you, that is also unique is a challenge,
			but there is a way to make sure you have a unique tattoo unlike anyone elses.</p>
        <p>Even the most complex of a tattoo might be on another person's body, so you have to make sure that the one thing that is permenent on your body is not going to be on someone elses
				as well. Even if you are in love with a tattoo that you found on the internet, changes a few things to make it unique goes a long way.</p>
        <h3>Pintrest and Google</h3>
        <p>Pintrest and Google is always where I start to find tattoos, but that is never the tattoo that ends up on my body. These two options are a great starting point, but never your finishing point.
				This is something that is going to be on your body forever and the last thing that you want is a matching tattoo with a person you do not know. Inspiration is the key word to this topic.
			It is important to find inspiration for your tattoo, but it is another thing to steal the work.</p>
			<h3>So Now What?</h3>
			<p>So you found your inspriation picture for your tattoo and now you don't know what to do. Well I have options for you...</p>
			<p>The tattoo artists are always making sure that your tattoo is unique, either they will hand draw your tattoo on your body, or they will take time to draw it out before hand.
				Artists are not going to give you a basic pintrest tattoo, you are the client and you are the priority. The art going on your body is also their art that they are creating for you,
				they do not want to steal that from someone else and put it on your body either. Work with the artist and you will get a unique tattoo.</p>
				<p>If you really want to support the tattoo industry, I urge you to find an artist that is not the tattoo artist that will create your tattoo. For a small amount of money, or even
					maybe free, you will be able to find someone that will draw out a unique piece that absolutely no one else will have. I personally draw out tattoos for people that are looking for a
					complex tattoo and give it to them to take to the artist. It is one of the most secure ways to ensure you are getting a one of a kind tattoo because you will be going through two pwople that are going to make sure your tattoo is like no other.
